# Project Overview

In this practice project, I will be creating an Express Server with secured endpoints allowing users from the client to access certain data. I will also be using MongoDB as my cloud storage to store user data. For this project I will be using React/NextJs for the client side rendering.

# Task

- Build a web app where:

    * Users can register & log in
    * Authenticated users can create, view, edit, and delete private content
    * Some endpoints are protected and only accessible with a valid token
    * MongoDB stores users and their data
    * Next.js handles UI and client-side requests
    * Express.js handles authentication & protected APIs

- Express Handles:
    * authentication
    * API routes
    * database access

- Next.js handles:
    * routing
    * rendering UI
    * state
    * conditional rendering
